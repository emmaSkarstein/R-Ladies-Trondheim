# Ideas for future events

- CV workshop, making your CV in R
- Hackathon event
- [Tidytuesday](https://www.tidytuesday.com/) workshop, let people pick their own data set from the TidyTuesday project, and make their own ggplot2 visualization, or modify one created by someone else?
- Related to above: Getting to know the mechanics of ggplot2: we give the code to a ggplot2 plot, and people get to modify it on their own. Not necessarily to make a nice plot, the aim could be to make it as ugly as possible, just to learn how to change various parts.

- Making your own R package - guided workshop where we create a simple/fun R package together
- Flash talks: how do you use R in your job?
