Ideas for future events:
- Hackathon (maybe good for Tekna collaboration)
- Taylor Swift data set :)
- Working through a vignette/data science book with R ladies
- Virtual meet up with R-ladies from Bergen
- event in Zurich was centered around the vitae r package: https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae
And they also had invited a career councelor from the university who gave some general advice about what to include/not include in a CV.
